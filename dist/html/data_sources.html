        <p class="descriptors">Data was downloaded from Finans Danmark, Statbank in May 2021. The Statbank information consists of prices in the housing market of completed transactions with the time, postal code and property category description. Units are in dkk/m2, and values are from the last quarter of year 2020. HomeLocator is using the average of the final listing price property categories (detached/terraced house, owner-occupied flat, and holiday home) per postal code area. Although HomeLocator is using and processing the latest dataset released by Finans Danmark, please note that this is just an estimation of house prices given a specific area.</p>

      <!-- Air Quality -->
      <div>
          <h3 class="section_titles">Air Quality</h3>
          <p class="descriptors">Air quality data was downloaded from the European Environmental Agency (EEA) in May 2021 and was provided in the format of 1km interpolated map grids. It covers Europe for the year 2018. It provides estimations of pollutants that are indicators of human health:
            <ul class="sub-points">
                <li>PM10 refers to an air pollutant that consists of particles with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 10 μm. The concentration values (μm/m3) represent 2018 PM10 annual average concentrations (90.4 percentile of daily means). The EEA limit value for PM10 per calendar year is 40 μm/m3 and it should not be exceeded on more than 35 days per year. </li>
                <li>PM2.5 refers to particular matter with an average aerodynamic diameter of up to 2.5 μm. The concentration values (μm/m3) represent 2018 PM2.5 annual average concentrations. The EEA limit value for PM2.5 per calendar year is 25 μm/m3.</li>
                <li>NO2 refers to Nitrogen Dioxide and consists of a group of highly reactive gases that can irritate airways in the human respiratory system. The concentration values (μm/m3) represent 2018 NO2 annual average concentrations. The EEA limit value for NO2 per calendar year is 40 μm/m3.</li>
                <li>O3 is Ozone. Ozone at ground level is a harmful air pollutant for humans and for the environment, and it is the main ingredient of “smog”. The concentration values (μm/m3) represent 2018 O3 93.2 percentile of daily maximum 8-hour running means concentrations. The EEA target is 120 μm/m3, not to be exceeded on more than 25 days/year, averaged over 3 years.</li>
              </ul>

      <!-- Crime and Political Data -->
      <div>
        <h3 class="section_titles">Crime and Political Data</h3>
        <p class="descriptors">Crime rates per municipality were provided by Statbank Denmark, for the first quarter of 2021. Data was downloaded in May 2021. The total number of offences were included in the estimation.
          Political data was also downloaded in May 2021 from Statbank Denmark. This dataset contains the political party in 2017 elections by municipality, and the valid votes were considered.</p>
