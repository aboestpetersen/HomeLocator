<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

HomeLocator was designed and built by Alexander Boest-Petersen, Christina Elmegaard-Fessel, Kristoffer Knudsen-Host, and Marcia Trillo studying at Aalborg University Copenhagen for the Spring 2021 semester in the Survey \& Planning and Land Management Masters Program from February 2021 to June 2021. Currently, HomeLocator is built with the focus of find areas within the country of Denmark, located in Northern Europe. Some areas may be missing grids due to data storage constraints of freely available services.

HomeLocator incorporates knowledge and practices garnered from GI Technology, Geovisualisation, and Spatial Planning courses in an attempt to develop a decision support system to aid prospective home owners locate suitable areas for purchasing their future homes and/or property.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy use the following git command:
```
git clone https://github.com/aboestpetersen/Spring21_AAU_Project.git
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The tool has been examined and indicates the same areas as are considered by the governments of countries such as Poland, Sweden or Finland. Baltic Offshore Potential can help identify the most suitable places to establish the new offshore wind farms in the Baltic Sea with respective accuracy. Our product aims to reduce the time needed to search for new areas for wind farms, indicating areas with the greatest potential, which however, should be supported by detailed geotechnical and environmental research.
