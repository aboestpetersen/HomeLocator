      <h3 class="section_titles">Which parameters impacts the decision when property buyers choose theirfuture neighborhood?</h3>
      <p class="descriptors">In order to answer this question, it is necessary to make a rough categorisation of parameters that can impact the decision making. Therefor the categories Suitability, Livability and Accessibility has been defined and in the following section each will be elaborated. </p>
      <br>
  </div>

    <!-- Accessibility -->
    <div>
        <h3 class="section_titles">Accessibility</h3>
        <p class="descriptors">A key component of livability is accessibility. Accessibility concerns how easy it is to get to or from an area, but also how safely residents can get around and by which means. The UN’s Sustainable Development sub-target 11a aims to create strong national and regional development planning, in order to ”support positive economic, social and environmental links between urban, peri-urban and rural areas by strengthening national and regional development planning (ProjectEveryone). A key factor for reaching economic growth is accessibility. Proper infrastructure leads to a higher productivity and infrastructure planning can be a policy instrument to stimulate activity in declining regions. Infrastructure between cities, regions and even across country borders gives access to the national and international market (Piet Rietveld). Accessibility analyzes can indicate which areas have the greatest value. The central areas of a city usually have a higher value, partly due to better accessibility. Accessibility can thus be directly connected to the economy and make an area more attractive for both urban development and settlement.<br>
        The expansion of the motorway has given the areas between the major cities better opportunity to attract residents by making it easier for them to commute to the larger cities (Egebjerg and Simonsen). Infrastructure between cities are important, but a good social environment with daily activities, such as shopping, deliveries, renovation also calls for accessibility. For an area to be livable, the transportation network must be including, and it must offer alternatives to transportation by car. The location of the transportation infrastructure is essential as this has a direct impact on the pattern of use and development of the area (Arefi and Nasser). Residents should have easy access to health care, education, recreational sites, grocery shopping, social activities etc. by any mean of transportation (Murray et al.).</p>

    <!-- Livability -->
    <div>
        <h3 class="section_titles">Livability</h3>
        <p class="descriptors"><i>- the sum of factors that effects human’s quality of life.</i><br>
          The term <i>livability</i> is well-known within the scientific field of spatial planning, but within the recent decades the role of the notion seems to have changed and grown. Although many prominent names within the field, such as Jan Gehl, Kevin Lynch, Jane Jacobs has used the term, it is both hard to define and to measure. The term has been used in different settings and in relation to changing events over time (Mateos and Kulasingam). 
          Today before-mentioned Jan Gehl plays an important role in the definition of the term and includes prioritizing of humans in spatial planning to the term. This is for example done by considering their small physical size compared to the big buildings in the cities (Gehl). Furthermore, Duijvestein has placed livability on the sustainability agenda and shows how livability locally on the short-term can lead to sustainability globally on the long-term (Duijvestein).<br>
          With this present definition of livability it is possible to look into if we can measure it.
          <br>
          Livability as a human experience is subjective and cannot be precisely measured. It is connected to both economic safety, social environment and physical, and psychological health (Reza Shabanzadeh Namini).
          <br>
          <i>Livability Communications</i> is an American organization with the goal of helping cities to not only attract, but also retain residents and businesses. Livability Communications have developed a livability-checklist for home buyers to use in the search of their new home. The checklist includes questions such as:
          <br><br>
          “Can you imagine yourself being happy driving through this neighborhood daily?”
          <br>
          “Is there a grocery store within a short drive, or better yet, walking distance?”
          <br>
          or “Would you feel safe taking an early morning or dusk walk in this neighborhood?”
          <br>
          (Battles)
          <br><br>
          Despite livability being subjective, numerous international overviews of the most livable cities are made on an ongoing basis. One of the largest providers of the data for these overviews is the consulting company Mercer. The initial purpose for Mercers reports is to encourage employment mobility and by making the reports, it is possible for the employers to measure if livability goes up or down for employees when relocating, and compensate based on that. Mercer base their ranking on different parameters to determine the living standard in the cities, but the company does point out, that their measurements of standard of living is not equal to the quality of life.
          <br>
          With this in mind, Mercer measure a place’s livability on 10 different parameters:
          <br>
          <ul class="livability-list">
            <li>Consumer Goods</li>
            <li>Economic Environment</li>
            <li>Housing</li>
            <li>Medical and health considerations</li>
            <li>Public services and transport</li>
            <li>Recreation</li>
            <li>Schools and education</li>
            <li>Cultural environment</li>
          </ul>
          (Mercer)
          <br>
          Equivalent measuring parameters are being used within similar organizations such as The Economist Intelligence Unit’s (EIU) Global livability ranking EIU (Unit) or The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in their Better Life Index (Economic Co-operation and Development).
